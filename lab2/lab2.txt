Question 1: How do you specify a TCP socket in Python?
-specify address familiy AFNET and socket type SOCKSTREAM


Question 2: What is the difference between a client socket and a server socket in Python?
-server need to bind its IP and port number it listens to. 
-client has to initiate the connection so the server can accept it

Question 3: How do we instruct the OS to let us reuse the same bind port?

-We set SO_REUSEADDR flag to be 1

Question 4: What information do we get about incoming connections?
-We get "Connected by ('127.0.0.1', 65492)" so its IP adress and port number it listen to

Question 5: What is returned by recv() from the server after it is done sending the HTTP request?
-we first get the result of the request with is equivalent to curl -i www.google.com
-after we done, we just get empty string because no more response from google


my tast:
proxy serbver need 1 socket for communicate between proxyServ and proxy client
1 socket is to communicate between proxyserver and google serevr

# in proxy server, after you got the connection from proxyclient, you can fork
