Q2: After starting a brand new Django application and running the runserver command, what does the browser show you?
 the browser showed me "The install worked successfully! Congratulations!" screen

Q3: After creating the first view within polls, what does the browser show you when navigating to / and to /polls respectively?
 A: in /polls i see the message "Hello, world. You're at the polls index."
    in /, i see page not found(404) error

Q4: 
1.add 'polls.apps.PollsConfig'
2. do database migration 
-'python manage.py makemigrations polls' (this creates the tables we have defined in models.py)
-'python manage.py migrate' (this will apply the change)

migrate command will look at lines in INSTALLED_APP to create any new tables.
We need migration because this is how we update the model. In MVC architechture, 
whenever model changes, it calls .update() on all of the views that are associated with the model


Q5: What do you see after you log into the Django adminstration site? From a high levle, how do you get custom models to appear in the Django admin page
